It's a long time to smile again
I just don't know if I can do it
It's a long time to smile again
I wonder if I'm gonna get through it 

I got to find a way to get a hold on myself again
Before I even try to give my love to someone else again
There are tears to be cried, I'm too close to remember
No tears can be born until the old ones have given
