this is my first tab and it sounds rite to me.
i was just playing the chords of this song a few a days ago
and i was having my dad teach the piano part to me. And
today i was playing guitar and found this. Its the
openeing harmonica part and its also the Right hand
in the piano part. When it jumps the octive then go
to the 12th fret and play this same part.
Anyways enjoy it.
